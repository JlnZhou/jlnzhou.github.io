I am a Phd student at Inria Grenoble-Alpes and [Criteo AI Lab][CAIL]. \
I work under the supervision of [Julyan Arbel][JA] ([Inria Statify][Statify]), [Pierre Gaillard][PG] ([Inria Thoth][Thoth]), and [Thibaud Rahier][TR] ([Criteo AI Lab][CAIL]).

I am doing Theoretical Machine Learning, Optimization, Probability, Statistics.\
My current research is focused on Online Learning, Bandits Theory and recently, some aspects of Game Theory. I like theoretical guarantees (but also do some numerical experiments from time to time).

I am always happy to learn new things and I am interested in everything.\

(If you see someone sleeping on the floor in a conference, that's probably me, don't hesitate to wake me up to discuss.)
